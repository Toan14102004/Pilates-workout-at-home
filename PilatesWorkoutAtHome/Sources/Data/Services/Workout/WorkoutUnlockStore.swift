/// Owns which Discover workouts the user may open.
///
/// Per the Discover design note, every workout in the feed starts locked: the exercise list is
/// hidden until the user either watches a rewarded ad or subscribes. Subscribers are never
/// checked against the stored list -- they unlock everything, including workouts they unlock
/// after cancelling, which then fall back to whatever they paid an ad for.
///
/// Like `WorkoutProgressStore`, values are read through to `LocalStorageService` on every access
/// rather than cached in `@Published` properties: this type is built by `Dependencies.build()`,
/// and resolving another dependency from `init` runs before the container is ready and traps.
///
/// Main-actor isolated because `SubscriptionManager` is: the lock state is a question about the
/// subscription, and every caller is a view or a view model that already runs there.
