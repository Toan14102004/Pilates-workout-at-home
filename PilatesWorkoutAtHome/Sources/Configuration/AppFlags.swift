/// Build-time switches for the two monetization surfaces.
///
/// Version 1 ships free: no ads, no paywall, every workout unlocked. To turn monetization back
/// on in a later version, flip the two constants below and rebuild — nothing else needs editing,
/// because every ad and IAP surface is gated through this type rather than checked in place.
///
/// These are deliberately `let` constants, not the `KeychainStorage`/`LocalStorageService` values
/// the ad services also read: those persist across launches and can be rewritten at runtime,
/// which is the wrong shape for a release switch. The stored values still apply on top when
/// monetization is on, so an individual placement can still be disabled without a build.
